## 15.2-1

> Find an optimal parenthesization of a matrix-chain product whose sequence of dimensions is $\langle 5, 10, 3, 12, 5, 50, 6 \rangle$.

$$((5 \times 10)(10 \times 3))(((3 \times 12)(12 \times 5))((5 \times 50)(50 \times 6))).$$

## 15.2-2

> Give a recursive algorithm $\text{MATRIX-CHAIN-MULTIPLY}(A, s, i, j)$ that actually performs the optimal matrix-chain multiplication, given the sequence of matrices $\langle A_1, A_2, \ldots ,A_n \rangle$, the $s$ table computed by $\text{MATRIX-CHAIN-ORDER}$, and the indices $i$ and $j$. (The initial call would be $\text{MATRIX-CHAIN-MULTIPLY}(A, s, 1, n)$.)

```cpp
MATRIX_CHAIN_MULTIPLY(A, s, i, j)
    if i == j
        return A[i]
    if i+1 == j
        return A[i] * A[j]
    b = MATRIX_CHAIN_MULTIPLY(A, s, i, s[i,j])
    c = MATRIX_CHAIN_MULTIPLY(A, s,s[i,j]+1, j)
    return b * c
```

## 15.2-4

> Describe the subproblem graph for matrix-chain multiplication with an input chain of length $n$. How many vertices does it have? How many edges does it have, and which edges are they?


Number of vertices - $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

Number of edges - $\frac{n(n-1)(n+1)}{6}$

> Show that a full parenthesization of an $n$-element expression has exactly $n - 1$ pairs of parentheses.

We know, there is not requirement of parenthesis if there is only one element in expression.
But, when we have 2 elements in it, we require 1 parenthesis, covering both.
Simiarly, in case we have 3 elements in expression, we will need 2 parenthesis.
In short it can be said that there are $n-1$ parenthesis for $n$-element expression.
