# Dynamic Programming - Rod Cutting

## 15.1-1

> Show that equation $\text{(15.4)}$ follows from equation $\text{(15.3)}$ and the initial condition $T(0) = 1$.

- For $n = 0$, this holds since $2^0 = 1$.
- For $n > 0$, substituting into the recurrence, we have

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    T(n) & = 1 + \sum_{j = 0}^{n - 1} 2^j \\\\
         & = 1 + (2^n - 1) \\\\
         & = 2^n.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

## 15.1-2

> Show, by means of a counterexample, that the following "greedy" strategy does not always determine an optimal way to cut rods. Define the **_density_** of a rod of length $i$ to be $p_i / i$, that is, its value per inch. The greedy strategy for a rod of length $n$ cuts off a first piece of length $i$, where $1 \le i \le n$, having maximum density. It then continues by applying the greedy strategy to the remaining piece of length $n - i$.

$$
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
\text{length $i$}  &  1 &  2 &  3 &  4 \\\\
\hline
\text{price $p_i$} &  1 & 20 & 33 & 36 \\\\
p_i / i            &  1 & 10 & 11 &  9
\end{array}
$$

Clearly, by greedy we should have chose 3 peice, since 11 is maximum, but it will be a wrong choice.

## 15.1-3

> Consider a modification of the rod-cutting problem in which, in addition to a price $p_i$ for each rod, each cut incurs a fixed cost of $c$. The revenue associated with a solution is now the sum of the prices of the pieces minus the costs of making the cuts. Give a dynamic-programming algorithm to solve this modified problem.

```cpp
MODIFIED-CUT-ROD(p, n, c)
    let r[0..n] be a new array
    r[0] = 0
    for j = 1 to n
        q = p[j]
        for i = 1 to j - 1
            q = max(q, p[i] + r[j - i] - c)
        r[j] = q
    return r[n]
```

Just need to subtract the cost from the price.

## 15.1-4

> Modify $\text{MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD}$ to return not only the value but the actual solution, too.

```cpp
MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD(p, n)
    let r[0..n]={-1}
    let s[0..n]={-1}
    (val, s) = MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD-AUX(p, n, r, s)
    print "The optimal value is" val "and the cuts are at" s
    j = n
    while j > 0
        print s[j]
        j = j - s[j]
```

```cpp
MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD-AUX(p, n, r, s)
    if r[n] >= 0
        return r[n]
    if n == 0
        q = 0
    else q = -âˆž
        for i = 1 to n
            (val, s) = MEMOIZED-CUT-ROD-AUX(p, n - i, r, s)
            if q < p[i] + val
                q = p[i] + val
                s[n] = i
    r[n] = q
    return (q, s)
```

## 15.1-5

> The Fibonacci numbers are defined by recurrence $\text{(3.22)}$. Give an $O(n)$-time dynamic-programming algorithm to compute the nth Fibonacci number. Draw the subproblem graph. How many vertices and edges are in the graph?

```cpp
// memo based approach
int memo_fibo(int n,vector<int>& memo){
    
    if(memo[n] != -1) return memo[n];
    if(n==0) return 0;
    if(n==1) return 1;
    
    memo[n] = memo_fibo(n-1,memo) + memo_fibo(n-2,memo);
    return memo[n]; 
}
```

```cpp
// Bottom-Up Approach 
int bottom_up_fibo(int n){
    vector<int> dp(n+1);
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = 1;
    for(int i=2;i<n+1;i++){
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
    }
    return dp[n];
}
```

For subproblem graph, we have $2$ initial non-outgoing vertices and $n$ vertices with 2 outgoing edges each.
So, total vertices are $2n - 2$.
