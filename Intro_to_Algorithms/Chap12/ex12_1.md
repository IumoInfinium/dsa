> What is the difference between the binary-search-tree property and the min-heap property (see page 153)? Can the min-heap property be used to print out the keys of an $n$-node tree in sorted order in $O(n)$ time? Show how, or explain why not.

- Binary Search Tree property guarantees that all nodes in the left subtree are smaller, and all nodes in the right subtree are larger.
- In case of min-heap, there is just parent-child relationship.
Even though it has minimum value on top, but there is no order in left and right subtrees in it!

> Give a nonrecursive algorithm that performs an inorder tree walk. ($\textit{Hint:}$ An easy solution uses a stack as an auxiliary data structure. A more complicated, but elegant, solution uses no stack but assumes that we can test two pointers for equality.)

```cpp
INORDER_TREE_WALK(T)
    let S be an empty stack
    curr = T.root
    done = 0
    while !done
        if curr != NIL
            PUSH(S,curr)
            curr= curr->left
        else 
            if !S.empty()
                curr = POP(S)
                print(curr)

> Give recursive algorithms that perform preorder and postorder tree walks in $\Theta(n)$ time on a tree of $n$ nodes.

```cpp
PREORDER_TREE_WALK(node)
    if node != NIL
        print(node)
        PREORDER_TREE_WALK(node.left)

```cpp
POSTORDER_TREE_WALK(node)

        POSTORDER_TREE_WALK(node.right)

> Argue that since sorting $n$ elements takes $\Omega(n\lg n)$ time in the worst case in the comparison model, any comparison-based algorithm for constructing a binary search tree from an arbitrary list of $n$ elements takes $\Omega(n\lg n)$ time in the worst case.

Assuming, it takes $\Omega(n \lg n)$ for comparsion-based algorithm to construct a **BST**, and inorder tree walk is $\Omega(n)$, then we get sorted elements in less than $\Omega(n \lg n)$ time, which contradicts, the sorting of $n$ elements in $\Omega(n \lg n)$ in worst-case.
