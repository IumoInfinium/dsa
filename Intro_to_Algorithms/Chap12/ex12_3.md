        T.root = x;
    else INSERT(T,x)

> Suppose that we construct a binary search tree by repeatedly inserting distinct values into the tree. Argue that the number of nodes examined in searching for a value in the tree is one plus the number of nodes examined when the value was first inserted into the tree.

Number of nodes examined while searching also includes the node which is searched for, which isn't the case when we inserted it.

> We can sort a given set of $n$ numbers by first building a binary search tree containing these numbers (using $\text{TREE-INSERT}$ repeatedly to insert the numbers one by one) and then printing the numbers by an inorder tree walk. What are the worst-case and best-case running times for this sorting algorithm?

- Worst-case would be $\Theta (n^2)$ as the tree formed has height $n$ because we were inserting them in already sorted order

- Best-Case would be $O (n \lg n)$ for a tree that is approximately balenced. Since, the height of the tree would be almost $O(\lg n)$.

> Is the operation of deletion "commutative" in the sense that deleting $x$ and then $y$ from a binary search tree leaves the same tree as deleting $y$ and then $x$? Argue why it is or give a counterexample.

No, the order of the tree changes during deletion due to the successor of the deleted node

Delete A first, then B
```
      A             C         C
    /  \           / \         \ 
   B    D         B   D         D
       /
      C
```
Now, simulating, delete B firstm then A
```
      A            A          D
    /  \            \        /  
   B    D            D      C   
       /            /
      C            C

> Suppose that instead of each node $x$ keeping the attribute $x.p$, pointing to $x$'s parent, it keeps $x.succ$, pointing to $x$'s successor. Give pseudocode for $\text{SEARCH}$, $\text{INSERT}$, and $\text{DELETE}$ on a binary search tree $T$ using this representation. These procedures should operate in time $O(h)$, where $h$ is the height of the tree $T$. ($\textit{Hint:}$ You may wish to implement a subroutine that returns the parent of a node.)

No, need to change the $SEARCH$.

> When node $z$ in $\text{TREE-DELETE}$ has two children, we could choose node $y$ as its predecessor rather than its successor. What other changes to $\text{TREE-DELETE}$ would be necessary if we did so? Some have argued that a fair strategy, giving equal priority to predecessor and successor, yields better empirical performance. How might $\text{TREE-DELETE}$ be changed to implement such a fair strategy?

```cpp
TREE_DELETE(T,z)
    if z.left == NIL
        TRANSPLANT(T, z, z.right)
    else if z.right == NIL
        TRANSPLANT(T, z, z.left)
    else
        y = TREE_MAXIMUM(z.left)
        if y.p != z
            TRANSPLANT(T, y, y.right)
            y.right = z.right
            y.right.p = y
        TRANSPLANT(T,z,y)
        y.right = z.right
        y.right.p = y
